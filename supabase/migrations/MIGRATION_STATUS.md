## Migration Guidelines

### Before Creating a Migration

1. Review existing schema in Supabase Dashboard
2. Check for naming conflicts
3. Plan for rollback if needed
4. Consider data migration if altering existing tables

### After Applying a Migration

1. Update TypeScript types in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
2. Test affected features in the application
3. Update this status document
4. Document any breaking changes
5. Update API documentation if endpoints affected

## Type Sync Status

## Useful Queries

### Check Migration History
```sql
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations
ORDER BY version DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Verify RLS Status
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Check Table Sizes
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

### List All Indexes
```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  indexname,
  indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
