## Benefits

✅ **Visual Feedback:** Badge count shows active filters
✅ **Smart Categories:** Lifestyle, aesthetic, social preferences

## Technical Details

**State Management:**
- `useSavedFilters` hook handles database persistence
- Filters saved on apply, loaded on mount
- Category and mode now part of filter object

**Filter Count Logic:**
```typescript
const activeFilterCount = Object.keys(filters).filter(key => {
  const value = filters[key];
  if (Array.isArray(value)) return value.length > 0;
  if (typeof value === 'string') return value.length > 0;
  if (typeof value === 'number') return true;
  if (typeof value === 'boolean') return value;
  return false;
}).length;
```

**Database Schema:**
Uses existing `saved_filters` table:
- `user_id`: User reference
- `category`: property/yacht/motorcycle/bicycle
- `mode`: rent/sale/both
- `filters`: JSON object with all filter values

## Performance

- Filters load instantly from database
- Badge updates reactively
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Smooth animations via Tailwind

## Mobile Experience

- Tabs scroll horizontally on small screens
- Touch-friendly badge selection
- Full-screen dialog on mobile
- Optimized for thumbs
